# Bar

A simple console application to showcase learned design patterns.

### Design Patterns used:
The app uses 4 Design Patterns:

1. **Chain of Responsibility (Behavioural)** - used to pass a new order through the series of different bartenders and
to let them decide if they accept or forward the order.
2. **Visitor (Behavioural)** - used to extend the functionality (experience) of bartenders.
3. **Factory (Creational)** - used to instantiate different objects.
4. **Decorator (Structural)** - used to wrap drinks in order to add some additional behaviour to them.

### About the app:
Simply execute the client's code. After that the user has two options to choose from:

1. To be a customer who can order various drinks from the menu
2. To be a manager who can send bartenders to training/course
