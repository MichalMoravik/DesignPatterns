# Design Patterns

This repository represents an outcome from _Software Design Patterns_ elective I chose during my studies. I collected information about 20 design patterns and placed it here, in this repository, together with the concrete implementations.

## About the repo

**The Java code** for each of the design patterns is placed in the folder "SoftwareDesignPatterns/src/patterns".

**The concepts** (theory) of these patterns are described in the "SoftwareDesignPatterns_documents" folder.

The last folder in the repository is "Bar". Here you can find my **final project**, a very simple console application, that I presented during my exams. There is another README inside of this folder.

## References

Most of the patterns' code is mine except the following parts:
- Bridge Pattern - a simplified version of https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge
- Composite Pattern - the example is taken from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/composite-design-pattern/
- Flyweight Pattern - inspiration was taken from https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/tree/master/flyweight
- State Pattern - a simplified version of https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state

When it comes to the documents, most of the text is written by me. It includes my notes from classes and the knowledge I gained after reading several sources on the internet.

While writing the documents, I was highly inspired by https://refactoring.guru, awesome website where you can learn more about design patterns. Some minor text parts of the documents' content are taken from this website.

UML diagrams are mostly from my teacher, although there is one, Bridge Pattern's UML, which I took from https://refactoring.guru.
